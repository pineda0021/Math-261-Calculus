## üìñ Course Description

Math 261 introduces the foundational principles of **differential and integral calculus** with applications to real-world problems in mathematics, science, business, and data analysis. You will explore **limits, derivatives, integrals**, and how they help us model change, motion, and accumulation.

This course will prepare you not only for deeper study in calculus, but for the evolving fields of **data science and machine learning**, where calculus is a critical tool for understanding optimization, growth, and decision-making models.

## üéØ Course Objectives

- Understand the concept of a **limit** using graphical, numerical, and analytical methods.
- Apply **limit laws** and the **Œµ-Œ¥ definition** of a limit.
- Determine continuity and apply the **Intermediate Value Theorem**.
- Compute derivatives using:
  - Limit definition
  - Power, product, quotient, and chain rules
- Differentiate functions involving:
  - Trigonometric, inverse, exponential, and implicit functions
- Apply derivatives to:
  - **Rates of change**, **tangent lines**, **related rates**
  - **Optimization**, **curve sketching**, and **motion problems**
- Use **first and second derivative tests** to classify extrema and concavity.
- Evaluate **antiderivatives** and **definite integrals**.
- Interpret **Riemann sums** and apply the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**.
- Use **substitution**, **net change**, and **integration applications**.
- Solve real-world problems involving:
  - **Area**, **volume**, **work**, and **accumulation**

## üöÄ Looking Ahead: Calculus for Data Science

As we move through Math 261, you'll gain the mathematical foundation to excel in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **applied analytics**. Calculus underlies core ideas in:

- Optimization (used in AI models)
- Rates of change (used in finance, epidemiology, physics)
- Accumulation (used in logistics and forecasting)

Understanding these ideas not only helps you in STEM, but also opens doors in **statistical modeling**, **neural networks**, and **computational science**.

Together, we will **build the calculus intuition needed to move confidently into the data-driven world**.
